    This function performs a fire/disease spread simultion.
    Parameters
    ==========
    nNorth, nEast : integer, defaults to 3
        Set the north-south (i) and east-west (j) size of grid.
        Default is 3 squares in each direction.
    maxiter : int, defaults to 4
        Set the maximum number of iterations including initial condition
    pspread : float, defaults to 1
        Chance fire spreads from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
